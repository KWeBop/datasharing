## Chocolate vs Nobels 
on slide 14 or 23 in your week 3 lectures you have an example of chocolate consumtion in countries vs # of Nobels.
This is a classic example of an ecologic study and drawing conclsions about the fact that eating more chocolate 
might incrase your chances of winning a Nobel is called an ecological falicy. 
This is not a type of confounding and will therefor not benifit from randomization, standardization, stratification, etc.
